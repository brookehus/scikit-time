.. _ref_install:

============
Installation
============

To install the Scikit-Time package, you need a few Python package dependencies. If these dependencies are not
available in their required versions, the installation will fail. We recommend one particular way for the installation
that is relatively safe, but you are welcome to try another approaches if you know what you are doing.


Anaconda install (Recommended)
==============================

.. code::

    conda install scikit-time -c conda-forge

We strongly recommend to use the Anaconda scientific python distribution in order to install
Python-based software, including Scikit-Time.


Python Package Index (PyPI)
===========================
